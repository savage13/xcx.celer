Map

Map was aligned by hand based on what was seen at [frontiernav.net](https://frontiernav.net/wiki/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps).

Data appears to be in a spherical coordinate system and locations (lat, lng) were 
projected by a [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) in the y/lat direction to 
get things to align correctly.
